1. **Data retrieval**. The following query was run on [Scopus](https://www.scopus.com/) to gather a sample of 5,389 papers representative of the research area:
```
TITLE(
  (hand-writ* OR handwrit* OR hand-print* OR handprint*)
  AND (recognition  OR  verification  OR  spotting  OR  identification  OR  
      analysis  OR  segmentation)
  AND NOT( (on-line OR online) AND NOT(off-line OR offline) )
) AND (
  LIMIT-TO(SUBJAREA, "COMP") OR LIMIT-TO(SUBJAREA, "ENGI") OR
  LIMIT-TO(SUBJAREA, "MATH")
)
